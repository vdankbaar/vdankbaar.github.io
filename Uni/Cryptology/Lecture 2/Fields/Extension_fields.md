$\mathbb{F}_p[X]/q(X)$ the ring of polynomials in $X$  
- coefficinets in $F_p$  
- degree below $n$  
- q(X) is irreducible: no factors of degree larger than 0 except itself  
  
has [Cardinality](../Rings/Cardinality.md) $p^n$  
$\mathbb{F}_p[X]/q(X)\setminus {0}, \cdot$ is a [Cyclic group](../Group/Cyclic_group.md)  
is a [Finite fields](./Finite_fields.md)  
  
$\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}[X]/q(X)$ is called an extension field if $n>1$  
exactly one finite field with $p^n$ elements  
- Different representations but all isomorphic  
$p$ is the *characteristic* of $\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}$  
- *Characteristic* of a field is the least positive integere p such that 1+1...1+1 (p times) = 0
