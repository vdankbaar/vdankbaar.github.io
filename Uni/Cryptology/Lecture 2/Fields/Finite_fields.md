A [Field](./Field.md) $F$ that is finite is called a finite field  
  
With a prime $n$ called a prime field or Galois field denoted $F_p$ or $GF(p)$  
  
  
Properties of $\mathbb{F}_p$:  
- Additive group has order $p$, multiplicative group has order $p-1$  
- Exactly one finitie field per prime  
- For example: $(\mathbb{Z}_4, +, \times)$ is not a field
