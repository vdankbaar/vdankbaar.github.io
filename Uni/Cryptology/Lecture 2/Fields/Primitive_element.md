For every $b$ of a finite field $F_q$ with $q$ elements $b^q=b$  
the order of a nonzero element is the smallest positive integer such that $b^k=1$  
ord(b) divides $q-1$ for every non-zero b  
element $a$ in a finite field $F_q$ is called a primitive element (or generator) of $F_q$ if $F_q$ = $0,a,a^2,..., a^{q-1}$  
A non zero element of $F_q$ is a primitive element $\iff$its order is $q-1$  
Primitive elements are not unique.
