Combination of two [Binary operations](../Basic%20terms/Binary_Operation.md) and a [Set](../Basic%20terms/Set.md).  
To be a ring:  
- The Additive [Binary operations](../Basic%20terms/Binary_Operation.md) must form a [Group](../Group/Group.md)  
- The Multiplicative [Binary operations](../Basic%20terms/Binary_Operation.md) must be [Closed](../Properties/Closed.md), [Associative](../Properties/Associative.md) and have a [Neutral element](../Properties/Neutral_element.md).  
- A ring must also be distributive with respect to addition  
Can be denoted like $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}, +, \times)$.  
  
  
If commutativity holds then it is a commutative ring
