Has [Cardinality](./Cardinality.md)  
Addition stays the same  
Multiplication is:  
1. Normal polynomial multiplication  
2. Reduction a polynomial $q(X)$  
3. $q(X)$ has degree $d$  
Multiplication is [Closed](../Properties/Closed.md), [Associative](../Properties/Associative.md) and has a [Neutral element](../Properties/Neutral_element.md)  
So the ring is finite   
Denoted $\mathbb{Z}_n[X]/q(X)$
