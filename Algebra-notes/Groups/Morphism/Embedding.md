title: Embedding  
---  
# Embedding  
For a given [Group-homomorphism](./Group-homomorphism.md) $f: G \rightarrow G'$:   
If there is a [Group-isomorphism](./Group-isomorphism.md) $G \rightarrow Im(f)$, it is called an embedding.  
  
An embedding is equivalent to an [Injective](../../Mapping/Injective.md) [Group-homomorphism](./Group-homomorphism.md).  
  
In simple terms, this means that the complete mathematical structure, in this case $Im(f)$, is 'embedded' or contained within $G'$.  
The [Group-isomorphism](./Group-isomorphism.md) describes how to go back and forth between the original structure $G$ and the embedded structure $Im(f)$.  
  
Embeddings are denoted as: $G\hookrightarrow G'$
