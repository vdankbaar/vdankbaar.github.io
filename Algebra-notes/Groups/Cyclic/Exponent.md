# Exponent  
With [Group](../Group.md) $G$ and $a$ and element in $G$,  
The [Subset](../../Sets/Subset.md) of all elements $a^n$ ($n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$) is a [Cyclic](./Cyclic.md) [Subgroup](../Subgroup.md) of $G$.  
A number $m$ is called an exponent of $a$ if:  
- $a^m=e$   
- $m>0$  
It is also an exponent of $G$ if:  
- $x^m=e$ for all $x$ in $G$  
- $m>0$
