# Period  
With:  
- A [Group](../Group.md) $G$  
- An element $a$ in $G$  
- A [Group-homomorphism](../Morphism/Group-homomorphism.md) $f:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow G$ for which $f(n)=a^n$  
- The [Kernel](../Morphism/Kernel.md) of $f$ called $H$  
There are two cases:  
## Infinite Period  
In this case the kernel $H$ is [Trivial](../Trivial.md).  
$f$ is a [Group-isomorphism](../Morphism/Group-isomorphism.md) of $\mathbb{Z}$ onto the [Cyclic](./Cyclic.md) [Subgroup](../Subgroup.md) of $G$ as [generated](../Generator.md) by $a$ and this [Subgroup](../Subgroup.md) is infinite [Cyclic](./Cyclic.md). Meaning it has an infinite amount of elements. This is also expressed as $a$ having an infinite period.  
  
## Period  
In this case the kernel $H$ is not [Trivial](../Trivial.md).  
The smallest positive integer in the kernel is called the period of $a$.
