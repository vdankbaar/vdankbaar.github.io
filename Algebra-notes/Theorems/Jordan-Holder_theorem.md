# Jordan-Holder Theorem  
Let:  
- $G$ be a [Group](../Groups/Group.md)  
- $G=G_1\supset G_2 \supset \dots \supset G_r = \{e\}$ a [Normal](../Groups/Normal.md) [Tower](../Towers/Tower.md) such that:  
	- Each [Group](../Groups/Group.md) $G_i/G_{i+1}$ is [Simple](../Groups/Simple.md)  
	- $G_i\neq G_{i+1}$ for $i=1,â€¦,r-1$  
Then any other [Normal](../Groups/Normal.md) [Tower](../Towers/Tower.md) of $G$ having the same properties is [Equivalent](../Towers/Equivalent.md).
