## Closure  
### Closed under Law of Composition  
[Set](./Sets/Set.md) $H$ is closed under a [Law of composition](./Law-of-composition.md) if:  
$$H\times H \rightarrow H$$  
And not for some other set $G$:  
$$H\times H \rightarrow G$$  
In simple terms, no amount of applying the [Law of composition](./Law-of-composition.md) on elements in the [Set](./Sets/Set.md) $H$ should produce an element not in $H$.  
### Closed under Inverse  
[Set](./Sets/Set.md) $H$ is closed under inverse if every elements inverse is also in $H$.
