## Unit Element  
An element $e$ in [Set](./Sets/Set.md) $S$ that for all $x$ in $S$:  
$$ex = x = xe$$  
This includes a commonly used step:  
$$e=ee$$  
$S$ is a [Set](./Sets/Set.md) that has a [Law of composition](./Law-of-composition.md).  
### Examples of Unit Elements  
- 1 for the [Set](./Sets/Set.md) with multiplication as its [Law of composition](./Law-of-composition.md)  
- 0 for the [Set](./Sets/Set.md) with addition as its [Law of composition](./Law-of-composition.md)
