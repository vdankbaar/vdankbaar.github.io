title: Group-automorphism  
---  
# Group-automorphism  
Group-automorphisms work similar to [Monoid-automorphisms](../../Monoids/Morphisms/Automorphism.md).  
  
Additionally:  
With [Group-homomorphism](./Group-homomorphism.md) $G$,  
$Aut(G)$ denotes the [Group](../Group.md) of all Group-automorphisms of $G$.
