title: Group-isomorphism  
---  
# Group-isomorphism  
Group-isomorphism works similar to [Monoid-isomorphism](../../Monoids/Morphisms/Isomorphism.md).  
  
Additionally:  
With [Isomorphic](../../Monoids/Morphisms/Isomorphism.md) [Group-homomorphisms](./Group-homomorphism.md) $f: G \rightarrow G'$ and $g:G' \rightarrow G''$:  
* $f\circ g: G \rightarrow G''$ is also an [Isomorphism](../../Monoids/Morphisms/Isomorphism.md)  
* $f^{-1}: G' \rightarrow G$ is also an [Monoid-isomorphism](../../Monoids/Morphisms/Isomorphism.md)
