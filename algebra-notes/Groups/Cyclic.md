# Cyclic  
A [Group](./Group.md) $G$ is Cyclic if there exists an element $a$ in $G$ such that every element of $G$ is of the form:  
- $a^n$ with multiplication as the [Law of composition](../Law-of-composition.md)  
- $an$ with addition as the [Law of composition](../Law-of-composition.md)  
$a$ is called the cyclic [Generator](./Generator.md).
