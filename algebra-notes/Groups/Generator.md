# Generator  
With a [Group](./Group.md) $G$ and a [Subset](../Sets/Subset.md) of $G$ called $S$,  
The [Subset](../Sets/Subset.md) $S$ generates $G$ if all elements of $G$ can be expressed as a product of elements of $S$ and their inverses.  
The [Set](../Sets/Set.md) of these various products becomes a [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) of $G$ itself (the empty product is the [Unit%20Element](../Unit%2520Element.md)).  
  
>[Subset](../Sets/Subset.md) $S$ generates [Group](./Group.md) $G$ if and only if the smallest [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) of $G$ containing all the elements of $S$ is $G$ itself  
  
If this does not seem intuitive, remember that a [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) requires  
Given that $S$ generates $G$, any generated subgroup of $G$ containing $S$ will have at a minimum all of $G$'s elements. Due to this the smallest subgroup of $G$ will be $G$ itself, not smaller.  
  
Ways to write this property:  
- $S$ is a [Set](../Sets/Set.md) of generators for $G$.   
- $S$ generates $G$  
- Mathematically it is written as: $G=\langle S\rangle$
