With a [Group](./Group.md) $G$ and a [Subset](../Sets/Subset.md) $S$,  
The centralizer of $S$ called $Z_s$ is a [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) of all $x$ in $G$ for which: $xyx^{-1}=y$ for all y in $S$.  
  
In simple terms:  
Since $xyx^{-1}=y$ is equivalent to $xy=yx$,  
$Z_s$ is the [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) of all elements in $G$ that [Commute](../Commutativity-(Abelian).md) with all elements in $S$.  
## Center  
The centralizer of $G$ is called the center of $G$. It is a [Normal](./Subgroup.md#Normal) [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) that contains all the elements in $G$ that [Commute](../Commutativity-(Abelian).md) with all elements of $G$.
