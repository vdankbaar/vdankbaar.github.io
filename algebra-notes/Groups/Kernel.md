# Kernel  
With a [Group-homomorphism](./Morphisms/Group-homomorphism.md) $f: G \rightarrow G'$ and the [Unit elements](../Unit%2520Element.md) $e$ and $e'$ of $G$ and $G'$ respectively:  
The kernel $H$ of $f$ is a [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) of $G$ where for all $x$: $f(x)=e'$.  
The kernel of $f$ can be denoted as $Ker(f)$
