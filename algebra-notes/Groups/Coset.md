# Coset  
With [Group](./Group.md) $G$, a [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) $H$ and element $a$ in $G$:  
A left coset is of the form $aH$.  
A right coset is of the form $Ha$.  
An element in $aH$ or $Ha$ is called a coset representative.  
  
Each element $a$ in $G$ becomes a coset.  
There is a [Bijective](../Mapping/Bijective.md) map $x \mapsto ax$ that maps an element $x$ in $H$ onto $aH$ or $Ha$.  
Due to the [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) $H$ staying the same between the cosets when $a$ is varied, each coset will have the same [Cardinality](../Sets/Cardinality.md).  
  
$G$ is the disjoint union of the left cosets of $H$ (same applied to right cosets).  
  
The number of cosets is called the index of $H$ in $G$.  
It is denoted by $(G:H)$  
The index of the trivial [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) is called the [Order](./Order.md) can be denoted by $(G:1)$.  
  
Example of the cosets produced by [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) $H: \{0,4\}$ under the [Additive](../Law%2520of%2520composition.md#additive) [Group](./Group.md) $Z_8$.
