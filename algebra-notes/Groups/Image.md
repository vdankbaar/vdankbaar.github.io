# Image  
With a [Group-homomorphism](./Morphisms/Group-homomorphism.md) $f: G \rightarrow G'$  
The image $H'$ is a [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) of $G'$ that contains all the elements that $f$ maps to.  
So it contains at least:  
- The [Unit Element](../Unit-Element.md) of $G'$: $e'$  
- Any element $f(xy)$ given $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are in $H'$  
- Any element $f(x)^{-1}$ or $f(x^{-1})$  
The Image $f$ can be denoted as $Im(f)$
