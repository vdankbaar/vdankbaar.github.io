# Subgroup  
A subset $H$ is a subgroup of [Group](./Group.md) $G$ if:  
- $H$ contains the [Unit Element](../Unit-Element.md)  
- $H$ is [Closed](../Closure.md#closed-under-law-of-composition) under $G$'s [Law of composition](../Law-of-composition.md)  
- $H$ is [Closed](../Closure.md#closed-under-inverse) under inverse  
## Trivial  
A subgroup is trivial if it only consists of the [Unit Element](../Unit-Element.md).
