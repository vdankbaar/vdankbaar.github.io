A subset $H$ is a subgroup of [Group](./Group.md) $G$ if:  
- $H$ contains the [Unit Element](../Unit%20Element.md)  
- $H$ is [Closed](../Closure.md#Closed%20under%20law%20of%20composition) under $G$'s [Law of composition](../Law%20of%20composition.md)  
- $H$ is [Closed](../Closure.md#Closed%20under%20inverse) under inverse  
## Trivial  
A subgroup is trivial if it only consists of the [Unit Element](../Unit%20Element.md).
