With a [Group](./Group.md) $G$ and a [Normal](./Subgroup.md#Normal) [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) $H$,  
The [Group](./Group.md) of [Cosets](./Coset.md) of $H$ is denoted by $G/H$.  
This is read as:  
- $G$ modulo $H$  
- $G$ mod $H$  
- The factor group of $G$ by $H$  
  
With $x$ and $y$ in $G$,  
$x$ and $y$ being in the same coset of $H$ is denoted by: $x\equiv y$ (mod $H$)  
This is read as "$x$ and $y$ are congruent modulo $H$".  
Another way to say this is:  
- $xy^{-1}$ lies in $H$ for a multiplicative [Law of composition](../Law%20of%20composition.md)  
- $x-y$ lies in $H$ for an additive [Law of composition](../Law%20of%20composition.md)
