title: Normalizer  
---  
# Normalizer  
With a [Group](./Group.md) $G$ and [Subset](../Sets/Subset.md) $S$ of $G$,  
The normalizer $N_s$ is a [Subgroup](./Subgroup.md) of elements $x$ in $G$ for which: $xSx^{-1}=S$  
In simple terms: It contains the elements which don't affect S when composed.  
  
If $S$ is only one element then $N_s$ is also the [Centralizer](./Centralizer.md).
