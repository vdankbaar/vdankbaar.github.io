$$S\times S \rightarrow S$$  
## Empty Product  
The empty product is defined as returning the [Unit Element](./Unit-Element.md).  
## Properties of Laws of Composition  
- [Commutativity (Abelian)](./Commutativity-(Abelian).md)  
- [Associativity](./Associativity.md)  
  
## Multiplicative  
Using multiplication as the law of composition  
  
## Additive  
Using addition as the law of composition
